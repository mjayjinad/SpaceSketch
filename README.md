# SpaceSketch
SpaceSketch is an immersive VR tool for 3D shape creation and manipulation, inspired by Gravity Sketch but designed with a simpler, more focused scope. Built for VR headsets, it allows users to intuitively create, edit, and customize 3D objects within a virtual space.

# Key Features
**Shape Primitives**: Create and customize basic geometric shapes as building blocks for more complex models.

**Coloring & Scaling**: Apply colors and adjust scale along different axes to refine your designs in real time.

**Mesh Manipulation**: Precisely edit mesh structures to enhance object versatility and detail.

**Duplicate & Delete**: Easily duplicate or delete objects for efficient scene management.

**Undo/Redo Functionality**: Robust undo and redo system tailored for VR interactions, allowing error correction and experimentation.

# Challenges & Learnings
1. Developing smooth and intuitive mesh manipulation in VR presented unique UX challenges that required creative solutions to deliver a natural feel.

2. Implementing a reliable undo/redo system from scratch in a VR environment pushed my understanding of state management and user interaction design in Unity.
